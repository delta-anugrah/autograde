# Progress log

Newest first. One entry per working session or batch. This is what `git log` cannot tell you:
how far something was validated, decisions and why, events outside the repo (factory PC,
Lampung), what is blocked. Every Claude session prepends its final report here (`CLAUDE.md`
§8). Entries older than 3 months move to `docs/runbooks/progress-archive-<year>.md`.

Entry format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD · <area> · <title> (PR #n or tag)
Changed:        ...
Validated:      command → result
Not validated:  ...
Decisions:      ... (only when a decision was made)
Next:           ...
```

## 2026-09-30 · docs · Tidy the AI-facing docs (PR #196)
Changed:        CLAUDE.md 1392 → 172 lines, English, fixed section order, one-line index of rules 0-32
                plus 1b/1c. Old lines 14-1392 moved verbatim: rules/conventions/git/pointers to
                docs/rules.md, the make table to docs/commands.md, HTTP surface and contracts
                appended to docs/backend-overview.md, system role/stack/structure appended to
                docs/overview.md §12. New: .claude/settings.json (deny list + PreToolUse hook),
                scripts/hooks/guard.sh + guard.py + test_guard.py, subagents rule-reviewer,
                qa-runner, docs-sync, docs/REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md, this log. AGENTS.md symlink and
                the 7 skills unchanged.
Validated:      old-vs-new line diff: 0 lines of CLAUDE.md 14-1392 missing from docs/ (reviewer);
                rule index == docs/rules.md headlines (35 entries); 26-phrase keyword check all
                present; test_doc_links, test_dokumen_tanpa_em_dash, test_manual_doc,
                test_plc_docs_match_compose green; tests/unit 3122 passed, 1 skipped;
                scripts/hooks/test_guard.py 69/69 with the hook on Python 3.9.6 and 3.12.14
                (RED 36/36 against an always-allow hook first). Fresh-session recall test 4/4
                (plus 1 sawit question). Pre-PR run: rule-reviewer no blocking violations; ruff
                clean; tests/unit 3121 passed, 1 failed (test_doc_links, caused by the local
                session plan file excluded via .git/info/exclude, not in the PR); tests/e2e
                311 passed, 17 skipped; tests/integration 96 passed; test_guard 69/69.
Not validated:  full CI (runs on the PR).
Decisions:      rule numbering is frozen (cited by tests, docs, skills); new rules append 33, 34, ...
                in both files. AI-facing files in English; MANUAL.md and runbooks stay Indonesian.
                Hook copied from autoerp (separate .py, command-position matching, py3.9-safe).
Next:           follow-up PR, not this one:
                (1) ~15 code/test comments still cite "CLAUDE.md § Tests" or "§ Critical Rule 1"
                (e.g. src/palmgrade/workers/capture_save_worker.py:30).
                (2) CI does not run scripts/hooks/test_guard.py; the hook fails open on a crash.
                (3) .agents/skills has no symlink for mvs-camera, model-swap-eval, spek-pc-pabrik.
                (4) Rule 31: its 5xx wording may not match
                test_baris_racun_500_mundur_sendiri_tanpa_memutus_sambungan and
                GAGAL_BERUNTUN_PUTUS=3; read the test first.
                Also: moved `##` headings could be demoted to `###`. Run docs-sync monthly.
